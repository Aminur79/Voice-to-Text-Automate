# Voice-to-Text-Automate
This Python application converts spoken words into text using the SpeechRecognition library. Users can start and stop listening with keyboard commands, and recognized speech is saved to an output file. Easy to use, it requires a microphone and internet access for Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API.

# Speech Recognition Application

## Overview

This application utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken words into text. It allows users to capture audio through a microphone and transcribe it using Google's Speech Recognition API. The recognized text is saved to a `.txt` file for later reference.

## Features

- Start and stop listening using keyboard inputs.
- Capture audio input from the microphone.
- Convert speech to text in Malay (`ms-MY`).
- Append recognized text to an output file (`output.txt`).
- User-friendly prompts for starting and quitting the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `speech_recognition` library
- `keyboard` library

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition keyboard
```

## Usage

1. Ensure your microphone is set up and working.
2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. Press **`s`** to start listening. Speak clearly into the microphone.
4. Press **`q`** at any time to quit the application.

## Output

The recognized text will be saved to `output.txt` in the same directory as the script. Each session will append the new text to this file.

## Troubleshooting

- If the application doesn't recognize your speech, ensure that your microphone is functioning properly and that there is minimal background noise.
- Check your internet connection, as the Google Speech Recognition API requires it to function.
